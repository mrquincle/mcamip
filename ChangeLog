0.1:
First release.

0.1.1:
Should run stable now.
Removed select().
Frame speed added.
jpeg processing no longer via file, but direct.
Auto restart if camera power down or network problem.
No motion detection and clock yet, this is a bugfix release.
More examples added to README

0.2:
Added on screen clock

0.3:
Now sends a HTTP/1.1 request.
Added -Wall and -O2 as compile flags.
Fixed all warnings except for date format (depends on locale).
Removed statics in get_time_as_string();
Fixed IP address generation for print.
Fixed more programming errors.
Moved some stdout to stderr, and some printf to fprintf(stderr, 
so as to no screw op output to stdout.
Updated website http://panteltje.com/panteltje/mcamip/
for hardware.

0.4:
Added 10 ms delay before read(), this reduces processor load.
It also reduces speed at which the camera gets read.
Set KEEP_ALIVE option in socket.
Made default port and default IP a define in mcamip.h
Added program name to border of X display.
Added motion detection, -c flag.
Added motion detection threshold -e flag.
Increased http_buffer size 10x to prevent overflow on slow PC and in -v.

0.5:
Added jpeg single picture output (-j flag).
Updated README.

0.6:
Fixed disconnect problem by adding Referer field in http request.
It seems the DCS-900 uses this within a couple of minutes after connect
to verify the suplied username and pasword against.
If no match, then the DCS-900 stops sending data from /video.cgi.
Added control for recorded frames per second (when camera set to auto). 
Added a counter in the jpeg frame directory to keep the last recorded picure number.

0.7:
Added more header info in HTTP request, such as program name , Linux, X11.
Added -z camera stream output to stdout.
Added reporting and warning of low frames per second.
Added display of true frame speed and warning if frame speed lower the requested.
Removed space after FRAME in yuv output, this was a bug, now it also works with ffmpeg and transcode.
Added examples for ffmpeg and transcode encoding in README.

0.7.1:
Fixes in README only.

0.7.2:
Low frame speed detection warning with date over 2 lines.
Low frame speed detection at .75x requested.
Added display of version, server_name and server port in X windows frame.
Added date and time if speed warning or jpeg lib errors.

0.7.3:
Added server re-connect when read() returns 0 (EOF).
Changed other errors then EAGAIN in read() to server re-connect.
Added date + time in connect_to_server(), removed it from main loop read timeout and EOF.
Simplified error message in read timeout and EOF.
Added semaphore file for motion detection, so other programs can test this, -i flag.

0.7.4:
Reversed u and v so alphabetical order in usage display.
Fixed to '~/frames' in usage.
Added patch by Robert Light <robert_light@verizon.net>, it uses averaging of the light intensity to make
motion detection work better in low light.
Added configure, some name changes, for example CHANGES to ChangeLog, LICENSE to COPYING, etc, to be
compatible with configure.

0.7.5:
Decode separate to rgb24.
Clock now also in X output.
Clock added in rgb24 with new routine in alpha_num.c.
Made better YUV encoding by using al l4 pixels, this is needed so color text can be displayed.
Added user text on screen from ~/mcamip_os.txt, file read each second.
Allowed left right bottom top scrolling text in text_to_rgb24_buffer() in alphanum.c
Updated README, manual.
Added quiet '-q' option.


0.7.6: 
Added -b flag for no color in YUV output.
Bluntly copied the ffmpeg color CCIT spec conversion defines, to match ffmpeg and mplayer colors.
Other conversions are also in the source, comment out some if you like to play.

0.7.7:
The first pixel in a picture was still coded with the old color standard.. fixed it.
Removed double defines in video.c and alpha_num.c.
Added frame_number displat top left with '-n' flag.
Allowed multiple line in ~/mcam_os.txt.
Allowed comment character '#' in ~/mcam_os.txt.
Removed text_to_yuv_buffer() from alphanum.c.
Read timeout alert in video.c now uses text_to_rgb24_buffer, and always works on both X and YUV out.

0.7.8:
Added set io buffer to zero in main.
Added flush(stdout) in video.c
This to shorten delays.
Fixed a neg array subscript in color aasignent to u and v in video.c,
u and v now only taken from odd pixels in odd lines, and averaged over 4.
