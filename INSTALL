                                     Installing mcamip-0.7.4


mcamip needs libmath, libjpeg, and X with Xlib, libXaw, and libXt installed to compile.

To compile type:
./configure
make
make install


Note:
 If you used configure, and had an older version of mcamip installed using xmkmf, delete the old manual:
 rm /usr/X11R6/man/man1/mcamip.1x
 This because the new manual goes in /usr/local/man/man1/mcamip.1x, the old manual was empty, but
 needs to be removed to prevent 'man' from finding it first.


Alternative method:
if you have Imake installed:
xmkmf
make
make install
make install.man


More info in README.

After install you can type:
man mcamip

And for command line options:
mcamip -h
